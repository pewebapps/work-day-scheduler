Work Day Scheduler is a web application that allows you to plan your work day.

The Work Day Scheduler is split up into nine 1-hour time slots, starting from 9am and ending at 5pm.
The current days date is displayed below the title.

You can input text into each 1-hour slot, to represent what you will be doing for that particular hour in the day.
Once you have added text to a slot, you can press the save button to ensure it persists, between visits and refreshes of the web page.

The time slots text area backgrounds are color coded to highlight whether the time slot is in the past, present or future.
The colors are:

 * <grey>Grey</grey> for the past
 * <red>Red</red> for the present
 * <green>Green</green> for the future

The Work Day Scheduler has been deployed using GitHub Pages and can be viewed [here](https://pewebapps.github.io/work-day-scheduler/)
